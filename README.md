## ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps & CI/CD Workflow

This project is built with a **fully automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** using GitHub Actions, a cornerstone of modern DevOps practices.

1.  **Trigger:** Any `git push` to the `main` branch automatically triggers the pipeline.
2.  **Path Filtering:** The pipeline is intelligent; it only builds and deploys the service (frontend or backend) that had code changes, saving time and resources.
3.  **Build:** A job runs on a fresh Ubuntu virtual machine, checks out the code, and builds a production-ready Docker image using multi-stage builds for minimal size and enhanced security.
4.  **Push:** The newly built image is pushed and tagged on Docker Hub, creating a versioned, portable artifact of the application.
5.  **Deploy:** The pipeline sends a webhook request to Render, which triggers an immediate, zero-downtime deployment by pulling the new image from Docker Hub and restarting the service.

This end-to-end automation ensures rapid, reliable, and consistent deployments, allowing for a focus on feature development rather than manual release management.

## üì¶ Getting Started (Local Development)

To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* Docker & Docker Compose
* A Git client

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AmarNarayanDwivedi/ApexQuest-AI-powered-Learning-Management-System.git](https://github.com/AmarNarayanDwivedi/ApexQuest-AI-powered-Learning-Management-System.git)
    cd ApexQuest-AI-powered-Learning-Management-System
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create two `.env` files based on the provided templates.
    * Create a file at `./backend/.env` and fill in the values from `./backend/.env.example`.
    * Create a file at the root `./.env` for frontend build arguments (see the root `.env.example` in the repo). For local development, `VITE_SERVER_URL` should be `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Build and Run the Application with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    # This command will build the Docker images and start the containers in the background.
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:**
    * Frontend is available at: `http://localhost:5173`
    * Backend API is available at: `http://localhost:8000`
